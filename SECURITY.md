## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have believe to have found a vulnerability in my action or related packages, please contact me immediately by emailing `security@ryand.ca` or messaging my [Discord](https://discord.com/users/660292639412846621) to disclose a potential security vulnerability. If it is a package that is related, that package will be updated immediately (if there is an update) and a new release will be pushed.
